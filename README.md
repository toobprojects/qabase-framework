# QABase Framework - For Automated Testing

This project provides a flexible and extensible framework for automating REST API & Web UI tests using **Spring Boot**, **Kotlin**, **JUnit 5**, **REST Assured**, **Selenide** and **Allure Reports**. It aims to make it easy to test and validate your APIs or Web Front-Ends with detailed, visually rich reports generated by Allure. This **Kotlin**-based framework is mainly to simplify project setup for **QA Engineers**
<br/>
<br/>

## TECH STACK

- **Spring Boot 3.4.2** : Leverages Spring Boot's robust features for creating a well-organized test suite.
- **JUnit 5** : Modern testing framework that supports advanced features like parameterized tests and lifecycle hooks.
- **Kotlin 2.x** : Written in Kotlin, providing concise and expressive code.
- **REST Assured**: Simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and validating responses.
- **Kotlin Serialization**: Handles JSON serialization and deserialization efficiently.
- **Selenide**: Simplifies UI test automation by providing a concise, fluent API for stable and readable Selenium-based tests.
- **Allure Reports**: Rich, detailed test reports with attachments, screenshots, and status codes.
  <br/>
  <br/>

## FEATURES

The **qabase-framework** parent module contains the following modules :

- **qabase-core** : For your basic Junit testing without much integration to APIS or Web Front Ends. Plain Junit 5 with Allure Reports
- **qabase-http** : For REST API Integration Resting.
- **qabase-web-ui** : For Web Framework UI Testing.

So you can pick and choose any of the modules mentioned based on your requirements.
<br/>
<br/>

## GETTING STARTED

### Prerequisites

You will first need to install the following tools and software development kits.

- Java 21+ _( since we are using Kotlin for the JVM )_
- Kotlin 2.1.0+
- Maven
- Spring Boot 3.4.2+
  <br/>
  <br/>

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tlmatjuda/qabase-framework.git
   cd qabase-framework
   ```
2. Build the project : `mvn clean install`
3. Running the tests : `mvn clean test`
4. After running the tests, the Allure report will be generated in the target/allure-results directory. To view the report locally, use the following command : `mvn allure:serve`
   <br/>
   <br/>

## USAGE EXAMPLES

We have created separate projects that use this framework respectively.<br/>
There are also some sample tests in the respective modules :

- **qabase-http** : `com.toob.qabase.http.TodoApiTest`
- **qabase-web-ui** : `com.toob.qabase.webui.test.DemoBlazeTest`
  <br/>
  <br/>

[](https://)Otherwise you can refer to the full usage examples on the following links :

- **[qabase-http](https://github.com/tlmatjuda/qabase-http-showcase)**
- **[qabase-web-ui](https://github.com/tlmatjuda/qabase-http-showcase)**
  <br/>
  <br/>

## KEY POINTS:

- **Single Flow:** All setup steps (clone the repo, build, test, and view reports) are included in one seamless section. No separate sub-sections for different steps.
- **Clear Command Flow:** The file includes all commands and steps from `mvn clean install` to generating the Allure report using `mvn allure:serve`, all presented in one continuous process.
- **Test Example:** The test case is presented in full, showcasing how to use the framework.
